Cause in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shoes on get up in the morn
Cup of milk lets rock and roll
King Kong kick the drum rolling on like a RollingStone
Sing song when Im walking home
Jump up to the top LeBron
Ding dong call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong huh
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom Im ready woohoo
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah this beat chaching like money huh
Disco overload Im into that Im good to go
Im diamond you know I glow up
Hey so lets go
Cause in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight hey
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So light it up like dynamite whoa oh oh
Bring a friend join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up talk the talk
Just move like we off the wall
Day or night the skys alight
So we dance to the break of dawn
Ladies and gentlemen I got the medicine
So you should keep ya eyes on the ball huh
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom Im ready woohoo
