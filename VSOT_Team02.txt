Due to the impact of pandemic, I think the mental wellness in my community has declined as compared to the days before the pandemic. However, I am pretty sure the mental wellness in the community is also moving into a better place as restrictions are reduced etc. I hope all individuals is able to achieve an optimal mental health.
People of every age to feel comfortable about stating their issues, being able to go to the counselors without feeling embarrassed. Everyone is able to create a positive effect on their emotional/ social aspect. Overall, improving everyone's quality of life.
my vision is for mental health to gain more awareness especially in the older generation
I hoped happiness could be achieved by everyone, no matter who they are, where they come from.
The World Health Organization provides a mental wellness definition: “A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.” So, my vision is raise awareness about mental wellness and introduce ways to maintain and improve mental wellness. I start by using my instagram account to promote and discuss about mental wellness. I post video too on my reel instagram in a series name "grow with me". I just start it, still episode one but the response are great. I start to search and learn more, so i can share it to others.
