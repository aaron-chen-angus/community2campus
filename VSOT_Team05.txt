I hope that my community become more aware about the importance of mental wellness. I hope people are brave enough to tell others that they are not okay mentally without being fear to be judged, but don’t make the “unbalance” of their mental wellness become an excuse to do no good to other people. 
In my environment, Nowadays people are starting to be aware of their mental health, which is important, along with the many sources of information about mental health, easy access makes people more aware of what they feel about themselves, but perceived access to Psychiatric service centers are still difficult in our environment, psychological institutions are also difficult to access.
my vision for mental wellness in my community is i want people in my community to be aware that mental wellnes is as important as physcial being too, which can be started from giving people in my community some awareness about mental wellness
